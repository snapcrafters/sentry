## Install

Before installing or upgrading, make sure you have the following availiable:

* Postgres database.
* Redis database.
* Clickhouse database. (as of 21.5.0)
* Zookeeper service. (as of 21.5.0)
* Kafka service. (as of 21.5.0)
* Snuba API service. (as of 21.5.0)

> An example `docker-compose.yml` is included in this repository, and within the
> root directory of the package itself. This is to provide a quick, not suitable
> for production, way to get the required services running on the same host to
> test that the snap works.

Once you have these running, install Sentry with:
`sudo snap install sentry`

([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

This will install 4 things:

* A `sentry` command to allow you to configure Sentry.
* 3 daemons, consisting of web, worker and cron.

The daemons can be accessed via `systemctl`, there names being:

* `snap.sentry.web`
* `snap.sentry.worker`
* `snap.sentry.cron`

At this point, we can initialise Sentry:

`sudo sentry init`

Note `sudo`.  This is because the daemons will be running as root (although confined by snapd).  If you run this without `sudo`, the running Sentry daemons won't be able to find the configuration files.

At this point, you can go and edit Sentry's config files to point them at your Postgres and Redis databases.  You can find the location of these files with:

`sudo sentry config discover`

Once edited, you need to run all pending migrations and setup a superuser with:

`sudo sentry upgrade`

Afterwards, restart the daemons with:

`sudo systemctl restart "snap.sentry.*"`

Now, you should be able to browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/join-snapcrafters/1325)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/joedborg/snap-pycharm-professional/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so Sentry can authoritatively publish future releases.
